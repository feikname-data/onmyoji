		<p>
		The table below shows the location of the Bounty Shikigamis in
		Onmyoji. &nbsp;Bounties refresh twice a day and is a good way to get
		Jades, Shards, and Coins. &nbsp;Using the table below, players would be
		able to find the Bounties quicker. &nbsp;I will update as often as I
		could.
		</p>

		<p>
		Note that Challenge Stages will offer at least 14 units of a
		Shikigami. &nbsp;However, because of the scarcity of Challenge Tickets, I
		do not recommend using them unless the Bounty is hard to find.
		</p>
		
		<p>Update July 24, 2017: Updated to be current with the Mainland China progress.</p>
