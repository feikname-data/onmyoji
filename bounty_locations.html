					<p>The table below shows the location of the Bounty Shikigamis in
						Onmyoji. Bounties refresh twice a day and is a good way to get
						Jades, Shards, and Coins. Using the table below, players can
						find the Bounties quicker. I will update this as often as I can.
					</p>
					<p>Note that Challenge Stages will offer at least 14 units of a
						Shikigami. However, because of the scarcity of Challenge Tickets, I
						do not recommend using them unless the Bounty is hard to find.
					</p>
					<p>Last update: Dec 25, 2018 - Hint updates for Vampira and begin adding JP information.</p>
