					<p>The table below shows the location of the Bounty Shikigamis in
						Onmyoji. Bounties refresh twice a day and are a good way to get
						Jades, Shards, and Coins. Using the table below, players can
						find the bounties quicker. It's a fork of
						<a href="https://onmyojiguide.com/guide/bounty-list/">this table</a>,
						but providing information for both EN and JP onmyoji instead of
						EN and CN, updated bounty hint information, consistency reviewed,
						typos fixed, and made way lighter.
					</p>
					<p>Note that Challenge Stages will offer at least 14 units of a
						Shikigami. However, because of the scarcity of Challenge Tickets, it
						is not recommend to use them unless the Bounty is hard to find.
					</p>
					<p>ヒント column entries with half <span class="unconfirmed-eq">like this</span>
						are ones I did not yet confirm if that half is the equivalent in the other language<br>
						<i></i> is used as placeholder for missing japanese info.
