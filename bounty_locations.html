					<p>The table below shows the location of the Bounty Shikigamis in
						Onmyoji. &nbsp;Bounties refresh twice a day and is a good way to get
						Jades, Shards, and Coins. &nbsp;Using the table below, players would be
						able to find the Bounties quicker. &nbsp;I will update as often as I
						can.
					</p>
					<p>Note that Challenge Stages will offer at least 14 units of a
						Shikigami. &nbsp;However, because of the scarcity of Challenge Tickets, I
						do not recommend using them unless the Bounty is hard to find.
					</p>
					<p>Update July 24, 2017: Updated to be current with the Mainland China progress.</p>
