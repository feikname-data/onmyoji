    The table below shows the location of the Bounty Shikigamis in
    Onmyoji. Bounties refresh twice a day and are a good way to get
    Jades, Shards, and Coins. Using the table below, players can
    find the bounties quicker. It's a fork of
    <a href="https://onmyojiguide.com/guide/bounty-list/">this table</a>,
    but providing information for both EN and JP onmyoji instead of
    EN and CN, updated bounty hint information, consistency reviewed,
    typos fixed, and made way lighter.
</p>
<p>
    Note that Challenge Stages will offer at least 14 units of a
    Shikigami. However, because of the scarcity of Challenge Tickets, it
    is not recommend to use them unless the Bounty is hard to find.
