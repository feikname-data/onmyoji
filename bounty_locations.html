					<p>The table below shows the location of the Bounty Shikigamis in
						Onmyoji. Bounties refresh twice a day and is a good way to get
						Jades, Shards, and Coins. Using the table below, players can
						find the bounties quicker. It's a fork of <a href="">this table</a>,
						but providing information for both EN and JP onmyoji instead of
						EN and CN, updated bounty hint information, consistency reviewed,
						typos fixed, and made way lighter.
					</p>
					<p>Note that Challenge Stages will offer at least 14 units of a
						Shikigami. However, because of the scarcity of Challenge Tickets, I
						do not recommend using them unless the Bounty is hard to find.
					</p>
					<p>Last update: Dec 25, 2018 - Hint updates for Vampira and begin adding JP information.</p>
